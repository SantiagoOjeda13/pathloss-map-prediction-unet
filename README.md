# pathloss-map-prediction-unet
# Pathloss Map Prediction with U-Net and Radial Sampling  This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks (Task_1_Participante.ipynb and Task_2_Participante.ipynb) developed for the MLSP2025 pathloss map prediction challenge. The overall goal is to accurately estimate indoor radio signal propagation losses (pathloss maps) using deep learnnig
